Welcome to the Raptor IoT platform repository!

Were you looking for the [API documentation](http://raptorbox.github.io/)

## What is this?

Raptor is a complete open-source solution for Rapid Prototyping of application for the Internet of Things or IoT

It is composed of an HTTP API and a MQTT broker (+AMQP and others) to create reactive stream of data of your devices

## Setup

### Vagrant setup

If you have vagrant installed on your PC just run `vagrant up` to get the services up and running for you

### Docker setup

***Coming soon***

### Build setup

This section cover the required to build the solution and run it inside `docker-compose`

#### Prerequisites

- Java SDK 8
- Maven 3
- Docker >= 1.12
- Docker Compose >= 1.9


#### Environment setup

- Install Java SDK 8. for Ubuntu distro (16.10, 16.04, 15.10, 14.04 and 12.04). The installer provides Oracle Java 8 (which includes Java JDK, JRE and the Java browser plugin).
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java -y &&
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```
- Install Maven `sudo apt-get install maven`
- Install Docker by following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- Install Docker Compose by following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

***Additional settings***

- ElasticSearch 5.0 requires to set a bigger max virtual memory areas. Set with `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

#### Build sources

There is an handy script for that in the repository at `./scripts/docker-setup.sh`

#### Start development build

To start the services run  `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`

## Getting started

***Work in progress!***

We are actively working to structure and expand the documentation!

To have a start we have the [documentation site](http://raptorbox.github.io)

### Querying the HTTP API

To get started there is a swagger based API documentation available at those addresses (once the appliance is up and running)

The default access credentials are username: `admin` and password: `admin`

- [Data and Object management API](http://localhost:8080/swagger.yaml)
- [User and Permission API](http://localhost:8090/auth/swagger.yaml)

The first operation is to login with an user and get an apiToken

```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "username": "admin", "password": "admin" }' \
http://localhost:8090/auth/login
```

You will get back a session token and your user details

```
{
  "token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJjcmVhdGVkIjoxNDc3NTU1MTIwMTM5LCJleHAiOjE0Nzc1NTY5MjAsInV1aWQiOiI1OTRkYjY4MS1kMDVjLTQ1OWQtYjg4MS1kMzJlNjQwY2E5MzcifQ.4khnaaAVyoMm_QWjES5NQ6uNbUaaCyrTfrGx47p2qUdFh6ZWtvafGrZvf7iiarIj50FeXrqoSc9N0XTOYaVnig",
  "user":{
    "uuid":"594db681-d05c-459d-b881-d32e640ca937",
    // ... other details
  }
```

With the token it is now possible to query the Data and Object Management API and start sending your data streams!

For example to list all the registered objects

```
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <the whole token>" \
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Accessing the MQTT broker

To access the broker open an MQTT (or Websocket) connection to `http://localhost:1883` using your username or password.

API Key based access is supported by setting an empty username and the API Key as password. Currently this feature is not completely working due to [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-826)

You can use any library supporting MQTTv3.1.1 like [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) or [Eclipse PAHO](https://eclipse.org/paho/)

## Libraries and tools

We are working to expand the support of SDK and libraries in different languages.

Here the list of available ones:

- [javascript sdk](https://github.com/raptorbox/raptorjs)
- [java sdk](https://github.com/raptorbox/raptor/raptor-client) (work in progess)
